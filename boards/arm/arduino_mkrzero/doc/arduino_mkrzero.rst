Arduino MKRZero
###############

Overview
********

The Arduino MKRZero is built around Atmelâ€™s SAMD21 MCU, which features
a 32-bit ARM Cortex M0+ core. It comes in a smaller format than the
Arduino Zero based on that same MCU.

Connections and IOs
===================

The `Arduino store`_ has detailed information about board
connections. Download the `Arduino MKRZero Schematic`_ for more detail.

System Clock
============

The SAMD21 MCU is configured to use the 32.768 kHz external oscillator
with the on-chip PLL generating the 48 MHz system clock.  The internal
APB and GCLK unit are set up in the same way as the upstream Arduino
libraries.

Serial Port
===========

The SAMD21 MCU has 6 SERCOM peripherals, each configurable to operate as either:

- USART
- SPI
- I2C  

SERCOM5 is configured as Arduino MKRZero's unique UART interface.

SPI Port
========

SERCOM1 is configured as Arduino MKRZero's unique SPI interface.

I2C Port
========

SERCOM0 is configured as Arduino MKRZero's unique I2C interface.

USB Device Port
===============

The SAMD21 MCU has a USB device port that can be used to communicate
with a host PC.  See the :ref:`usb-samples` sample applications for
more, such as the :ref:`usb_cdc-acm` sample which sets up a virtual
serial port that echos characters back to the host PC.

EIC
===

The External Interrupt Controller peripheral allows I/O pins to be configured as
interrupt lines. It is enabled from the GPIO driver configuration menu. The
interrupt -to- I/O pin mapping depends on both the MCU device variant pin count
and the peripheral signals multiplexing to the I/O pins for the considered
board. On Atmel SAMD21G for instance, both PA00 and PA16 can be assigned to
external interrupt 0. On the Arduino MKR Zero, which is based on this device
variant, PA00 is used for another purpose which leaves the user with PA16 as the
only choice for this particular external interrupt. The value 16 would thus need
to be configured for external interrupt 0. Below is the mapping table for the
Arduino MKR Zero. Also note that, unlike for other peripherals, the pin
multiplexing is performed by the GPIO driver as part of the I/O pin
configuration, that is, no code is needed in pinmux.c.

| EXTINT | MKZero Pin | PORT Group | I/O Pin |
+========+============+============+=========+
| 0      |  MOSI      | PORTA      | 16      |
+--------+------------+------------+---------+
| 1      |  SCK       | PORTA      | 17      |

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Debugging and programming the Arduino MKRZero requires using the
Atmel-ICE development tool with OpenOCD.

Flashing
========

#. Build the Zephyr kernel and the :ref:`hello_world` sample application:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: arduino_mkrzero
      :goals: build
      :compact:

#. Connect the Arduino MKRZero to your host computer using the USB debug
   port.

#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output. Under Linux the
   terminal should be :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`. For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -o

   The -o option tells minicom not to send the modem initialization
   string. Connection should be configured as follows:

   - Speed: 115200
   - Data: 8 bits
   - Parity: None
   - Stop bits: 1

#. To flash an image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: arduino_mkrzero
      :goals: flash
      :compact:

   You should see "Hello World! arm" in your terminal.
